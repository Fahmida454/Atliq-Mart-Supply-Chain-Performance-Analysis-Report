#### Analysis and Recommendations
The analysis reveals significant challenges in achieving high service levels, particularly in the areas of on-time and in-full deliveries. The overall OTIF% of 29.02% is considerably below expectations, indicating a critical need for process improvements.

**City-wise Insights:**
- **Surat** demonstrates relatively better performance in OT%, IF%, and OTIF% compared to Ahmedabad and Vadodara.
- **Vadodara** shows the lowest performance metrics, suggesting a need for focused interventions.

**Monthly Trends:**
- There is a slight month-to-month variation in OT%, IF%, and OTIF%, but the overall performance remains below target levels. 
- **LIFR** and **VOFR** percentages are relatively stable, with VOFR showing high performance across months and cities, indicating that while order value is being fulfilled, individual line items and overall delivery timeliness are problematic.

**Product Category Insights:**
- **Dairy products** dominate the order volume but exhibit similar LIFR and VOFR percentages as other categories, suggesting systemic issues rather than category-specific problems.

**Recommendations:**
1. **Process Improvements**:
   - Implement stricter monitoring and control mechanisms for delivery schedules.
   - Enhance coordination between supply chain stakeholders to ensure timely and full deliveries.
   
2. **Technology Integration**:
   - Invest in advanced supply chain management software to track and optimize deliveries.
   - Utilize predictive analytics to foresee and mitigate potential delays or shortages.

3. **Training and Development**:
   - Conduct regular training programs for the logistics and supply chain teams to improve efficiency and response times.

4. **Customer Feedback Loop**:
   - Establish a robust feedback mechanism to capture customer grievances promptly and address them efficiently.

5. **Pilot Programs**:
   - Run targeted improvement programs in Vadodara and expand successful strategies to Ahmedabad and Surat.
